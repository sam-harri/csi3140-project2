# Assignment 2: Yatze Game (JavaScript)

## Objectives

Students (in group) will build a single-player Yatzy game completely in HTML/JS/CSS.
The game will enforce the rules of Yatzy, will manage the game state (current score, current role, etc)
and will notify the user of the final score when the game is done.

Students can choose the implement another game such as the following

* [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
* [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle)
* [Spelling Bee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Spelling_Bee)
* [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))
* [Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
* [Paku Paku (1D Pacman)](https://abagames.github.io/crisp-game-lib-11-games/?pakupaku)
* [Math Crossword](https://scientific.place/math-crossword/)

Other games not listed above must be approved by a professor or TA
otherwise the student risks receiving a 0 if not appropriate.

You will build a single-player [Yatzy Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy)
using HTML/CSS/JavaScript in your `yatzy` GitHub code repository (rename the repo if you
chose a different game) based on your work during the labs.

## Description

A Yatzy game is has a player rolling five dice.
After each roll, the player chooses which dice to keep,
and which to reroll. A player can then reroll up to two times on a
turn. The player must put a score into an available score box.
The game ends when all the score boxes are used and a final tally
is given.

For this assignment, you can limit the number of Yatzies to just 1
(like any other turn).

## Deliverables

You will submit all code in your `yatzy` GitHub code repository.
You will create a `README.md` that describes how your game
works and screenshots of the various user interface states.

You will describe your game's visual design system using the techniques
learned in labs/tutorials to outline the structural / recurring components
(headers, footers, scoreboard, play area, etc), colour palette, and fonts / sizes.
The design system should be documented in `/docs/design_system.md`
and any related assets (images, docs, etc) should be placed in the `/docs/design_system`
directory.

You will add a technical (and visual) outline in your portfolio projects
section.

You will be graded on the following criteria.

| Mark | Breakdown | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 40. |     | Game Implementation
|     | 10. | Design System
|     | 10. | Quality of HTML/CSS
|     | 10. | Quality of JavaScript
|     | 10. | Correctness of game rules
| 10. |     | Intergation of game into portfolio
| 10. |     | Overall quality of project deliverable (including git usage)
Total : 60
